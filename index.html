    <h1>Racial Justice in Long Beach, NY</h1>

    <p class="intro">
        We are urging Long Beach elected officials to combat racism in all forms. Over the past few days, the true spirit of Long Beach emerged as residents from all walks of life gathered to demand justice for the senseless murders of Black people at the hands of police officers. Here in Long Beach, we know that diversity is our greatest strength. However, the historic legacy of racism continues to stifle our Black neighbors and neighbors of color. <em class="intro">We demand an immediate end to these policies.</em>
    </p>

    <p class="intro">
        Long Beach elected officials have the ability to make reforms to further racial equity now. The national movement has brought urgency to the local racial economic equity. We know that the path to true equality is long, but <em class="intro">we are committed to remaining united and focused in the following policy proposals.</em>
